<p class="latest-version"><em class="notice">25 December:</em> version 3.1 is here, with support for dynamically added links!

<h2>Why</h2>

<p>Despite huge bandwidth increases, websites don’t get much faster. This is because the biggest bottleneck in loading web pages is latency.<sup id="note-latency-back"><a href="#note-latency">1</a></sup>

<h2>How does it work</h2>

<p>Latency is inevitable with today’s internet architecture so InstantClick cheats by preloading links you are likely to click on.

<p>Before visitors click on a link, they hover over that link. Between these two events, 200 ms to 300 ms usually pass by (<a href="click-test">test yourself here</a>). InstantClick makes use of that time to preload the page, so that the page is already there when you click.

<p>On mobile devices, preloading starts on “touchstart”, letting 300 ms (Android) to 450 ms (iOS) for preloading the page.<sup id="note-3g-back"><a href="#note-3g">2</a></sup>

<p>If you want your website to not be flooded by requests, you can set a delay before preloading starts when users hover a link. It will still <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/" title="Jakob Nielsen – Response Times: The 3 Important Limits">feel instant</a>.

<p>If you don’t want any wasted requests, you may preload on “mousedown”. This is when you press your mouse button (a click is when you release it).

<p>When loading pages with InstantClick, the browser doesn’t show its standard loading indicators anymore. To make sure the user knows a page has changed, InstantClick includes a (customizable) progress bar.<sup id="note-progress-bar-back"><a href="#note-progress-bar">3</a></sup> The bar automatically scales to the appropriate size on mobile devices, so it works even when your site isn’t optimized for mobile.

<hr>

<p>InstantClick uses pushState and Ajax (a combo known as <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax">pjax</a>), replacing only the body and the title in the head.

<p>Ajax brings two nice benefits in and of itself:
<ul>
  <li>Your browser doesn’t have to throw and recompile scripts and styles on each page change anymore.
  <li>You don’t get a white flash while your browser is waiting for a page to display, making your website <em>feel</em> faster.
</ul>

<p>InstantClick supports the following browsers’ versions:

<table class="support">
  <tr>
    <th>IE
    <th>Firefox
    <th>Chrome
    <th>Safari
    <th>Opera

    <th>iOS Safari
    <th>Android Browser
    <th>Chrome for Android
  <tr>
    <td>10+
    <td>4.0+
    <td>5+
    <td>5.0+
    <td>11.5+

    <td>5.0+
    <td>4.4+
    <td>18+
</table>

<p>According to <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=pushState">Can I use</a>, over 80% of the world supports InstantClick. When a browser doesn't support it, InstantClick fully degrades.
